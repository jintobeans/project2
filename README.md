This was an attempt to make a browser-based app similar to snapchat, mainly for learning new web technologies and practicing react.

It is not fully functional.

You can take pictures, upload them to your account, delete them, and edit them by drawing over them and saving the new version to your account.

Technologies used:
-react webcam (to take selfie)
-HTML canvas (to draw things over images)
-played with Google vision API to analyze images and detect things (does not work now)
-sketchPad (vanilla js)
